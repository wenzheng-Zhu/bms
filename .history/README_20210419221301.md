Ruby version: 2.6.3
Ruby on rails version: 6.1.3

Noted: 
1.This document is relatively rough.
2.I didn't write the testing codes because of the time, but i tested the apis using postman.
3.Maybe the controllers are so heavy, but they can be more fast i think.
4.I config the quantites of books that one user can borrow and the fees that one book was lent per day in the   /config/application.yml
5.I didn't write the CRUD of users, books. i just wrote the apis according to the test requirement.
6.The account will be created after the user is created automatically.
7.You can run rails db:seed in the terminal that mock the testing datas.
8.The relations between the tables, as follows:
  user has_one account
  account belongs_to user
  book has_many incomes
  income belongs_to book
  loan belongs_to account





The apis are as follows(examples):
1. a borrowing transaction with parameters for the user's ID and the book's ID
   post url: http://loacalhost:3000/api/v1/users/:id/borrowing?book_id=4
   parameters are: 
          id(user's id)
          book_id(book's id)

2. a returning transaction with parameters for the user's ID and the book's ID
   post url: http://loacalhost:3000/api/v1/users/:id/returning?book_id=4
   parameters are: 
          id(user's id)
          book_id(book's id)

3. Query the account status of a user, the parameter is the user ID, return the current     balance, and borrow the books.
