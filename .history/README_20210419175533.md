Noted: 
1.This document is relatively rough.
2.I didn't write the testing codes because of the time, but i tested the apis using postman.

The apis are as follows(examples):
1. a borrowing transaction with parameters for the user's ID and the book's ID
   post url: http://loacalhost:3000/api/v1/users/:id/borrowing?book_id=4
   parameters are: id(user)

2. a returning transaction with parameters for the user's ID and the book's ID
   post url: http://loacalhost:3000/api/v1/users/:id/returning?book_id=4
